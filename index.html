        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science and Administrative StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jing Hu. I am currently a student at the Univeristy of California at Riverside. I was born in Shenzhen, China in 2003, and moved to the United States with my parents at the age of 2. My dad, Andrew, is an exporter, and my mother, Sandy is a hairdresser in Torrance. I grew up in a small Suburb in Los Angeles county, and have lived there my whole life. I decided to move to the Univeristy of California at Riverside my Senior year after College Applications. Although it was not my first choice, I thoroughly enjoy it here and have realized that I have a lot of potential to grow, learn, and meet new people. I am excited for growth and new opportunities in a new school. I am working towards being a Cosmetics Marketer or plan to work in Public Relations in the Cosmetics Industry. In order for me to achieve my goals and work towards my dreams, I decided to major in Political Science and Administrative Studies with a Concentration in Marketing, which I plan to fulfill in the next three to three and a half years. I have had a great interest in the Cosmetics Industry since I was very young, and I believe my interests have stemmed from my mother, Sandy. My mother always used beauty products and hair products whenever she had the chance, and it made me fall in love with the concept of beauty and makeup. As I grew older, I realized how toxic and not environmentally friend the beauty industry was, and I found a love to improve the industry and attempt to make it better.<br><br>

        I specifically love asian Makeup, but am incredibly interested in the American beauty industry as well. In the last couple years, American beauty has seen a great boom, with the industry including dozens of brand new brans. Rare Beauty, JLo Beauty, Fenty, and Kylie Cosmetics are just some to name. All these companies have taken over the world and created a new version of not only celebrity beeauty, but also regular cosmetics companies. Because of the increase cosmetics companies over the years, the Beauty industry has become more difficult to work with and far more competitve than the years before. I plan to make a greater mark in the industry, with a greater focus in clean beauty, inclusivity, and gender neutral cosmetics. I highly support comapnies who are against animal testing and animal cruelty (consumers can see this information by looking for a white bunny behind beauty products). I have seen that it is truly unnessecary for companies to continue animal testing. I stronly believe that with a degree in Politcal Science and Administrative Studies, I will gain the knowledge and information of past and current social issues to broaden my understanding of how the world works. In addition, the Administration and concetration in Business will help me increase my knwodedge on the business world, and how economists, administrators, and businesswomen and businessmen run their comapnies. <br><br>
